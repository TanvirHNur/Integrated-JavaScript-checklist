Integrated JavaScript checklist (9)

You were creating a website called leader-board-css3 a few days ago. 
Now open that website again. Then do the following. link(https://github.com/TanvirHNur/Leader-board)
-----------------*/





/* -----------------
1. There is a text called Top Players2022. Or Top Blogs. Give these two two IDs. 
Change the HTML and set the ID. Then find that element with JavaScript and change the color of its text.
------------------*/



/* -----------------
2. With JavaScript, give any of the divs in the player class any background color. 
You have to give any background color as you wish. However, the color is not hex color. Give rgba color. 
If you do not understand rgba. Then find a rgba color with Google search and then give that color.
------------------*/



/* -----------------
3. Add an ul list below the website. Add three items of your choice there. Then add a button below ul. 
Now it will be your job. Click on the button as many times. A new list item will be added to ul.
------------------*/



/* -----------------
4. Now add an input field and a button below ul. The value at the beginning of the input field will be zero (0). 
Then every time you press the new button next to the input field, the value of the input field will increase one by one.
------------------*/



/* -----------------
5. (Challenging One) The button above has two conditions. That is, even if the number increases, 
it will be a maximum of 5. That is, it can be increased one by one from 0 to five. It will not rise above it. 
And when 5, the button will be disabled.
------------------*/

Project Challenge link(https://github.com/TanvirHNur/interactive-shopping-cart)

6. Look at the design of the shopping cart. Then create a simple site by 
yourself with HTML, CSS (any framework bootstrap or tailwind if you want) or css3.
------------------*/



/* -----------------
7. Then work from the bottom of the list eliminating issues that aren't worth the fight.
 One condition is that you can do it without watching our video. If you can't watch our video. Then that would be very nice. Even if you don't watch our video, you can search on Google or YouTube. And if you can't do it alone. Then take a look at our video.
------------------*/


/* -----------------
8. An array contains the names (strings) of many English JavaScript related books. 
If you don't know the name of the JavaScript related book, do a Google search. 
Then run a loop to see which books have "javascript" in their names. Then put the names of those books in another array. 
And yes, when you check if you have javascript, you will notice that it is uppercase or lowercase. That means the case will be insensitive.

------------------*/



/* -----------------
9.9. Take an array with many numbers. Then sort that array. will be sorted by serial number from small to large. ------------------*/



/* ---
See if you can do at least 5 of these 9 tasks yourself. If you can do it. That would be great. If not, get help from other.
